# Native App, Web App and Hybrid App

**Application** (in short '**App**') is any material, product or a program which is designed for end-user to use. 
But now, **App** refers to applications based on iOS/Android system in more occasions. This app can be divided into 3 kinds: *Native App*, *Web App* and *Hybrid App*.

### Native App

*Native App* refers to programs installed on Android/iOS system, mainly written by Java, C++ or other back-end languages. Users can open a native app by clicking icons on main menu.
Normally, size of native app is about tens of MB ~ hundreds of MB, even 1 GB. Consequently, native app can support best experience for users.

### Web App
*Web App* refers to website application, implemented by html/css/js which can be opened in browsers. Obviously, web app is much lighter than native app, but its interface and interact is likely to native app. In addition, web app is **cross-platform**.
However, web app also has many limitations. It's harder to access local files, and users are more likely to lose their data, stored in the cache.

### Hybrid App
*Hybrid App* is combination of native app & web app. Hybrid app can invoke more functions of hardware, and its size is smaller than native app in same time. Like web app, it is developed by html/css/js or other technologies (such as wxss/wxml by WeChat) and it's also **cross-platform**. In short, hybrid app is more likely to native app **when using**, and more likely to web app **on technology**.
